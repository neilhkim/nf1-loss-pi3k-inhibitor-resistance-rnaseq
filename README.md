# Transcriptomic analysis of NF1-loss driven resistance to PI3Kα inhibition (alpelisib or BYL719) in PIK3CA-mutant ER+ breast cancer (GSE207514)

## Background

- PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is a key driver in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) / HER2-negative breast cancer.
- Activating mutations in PI3KCA is present in ~40% of cases (## REF).
- Alpelisib (BYL719) is a PI3Kα inhibitor improves progression-free survival in patients.
- However, reisistance builds.
- NF1, a tumor supressor and RAS-GAP, when absent, has been identified to enable bypassing of PI3Kα inhibition.

## Dataset

- RNA-seq data from GEO series GSE207514.
- Profiles T47D ER+ breast cancer cells harboring PI3KCA H1047R mutation.
- Includes 4 groups:
    - CTRL_Veh (control, vehicle)
    - CTRL_BYL (control, alpelisib)
    - NF1_Veh (NF1 knockout, vehicle)
    - **NF1_BYL (NF1 knockout, alpelisib)** 

## Primary Comparisons

Three key comparisons to understand the transcriptomic effects:

1. Drug effect in control cells
- CTRL_BYL vs CTRL_Veh
- What does alpelisib do in NF1-intact PI3KCA H1047R cells?

2. NF1 loss at baseline
- NF1_Veh vs CTRL_Veh
- How does NF1 loss alone change signaling and transcription?

3. NF1-mediated resistance under drug (*main project goal*) 
- NF1_BYL vs CTRL_BYL
- When treated with alpelisib, how do the drug-resistant NF1-KO cells' gene expression profiles differ from the drug-sensitive CTRL cells?
